# Yelp-Business-Review
In this NLP project we want to classify Yelp Reviews into 1 star or 5 star categories based off the text content in the reviews. 


Each observation in this dataset is a review of a particular business by a particular user. The "stars" column is the number of stars (1 through 5) assigned by the reviewer to the business. (Higher stars is better.) In other words, it is the rating of the business by the person who wrote the review. The "cool" column is the number of "cool" votes this review received from other Yelp users. All reviews start with 0 "cool" votes, and there is no limit to how many "cool" votes a review can receive.
